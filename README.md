# S4 electric field simulation

Python script for an S4 RCWA simulation in Lua to model and plot the electric field of a 1D guided mode resonance grating. The python file also extracts field intensity within a given permittivity region.

## Requirements
These scripts were tested using Python 3.11, and S4 requires Lua 5.2.4.
